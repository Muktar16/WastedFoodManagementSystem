Wasted Food Management will be a Web-based application. There will be three types of users- Admin panel, Restaurant representative and the other one is NGO representative. In this system, our purpose is to try to reduce restaurant food wastage by delivering waste food to NGOs. NGOs will send  requests to the system asking for a specific amount of food whereas restaurant representatives will let the system know if they have any leftover food. The admin panel will carefully observe the requests. If the demand of a particular NGO matches a particular restaurant’s leftover food, then the admin panel will calculate the distance between the restaurant and the NGO. If the NGO is within a five kilometer radius from that restaurant, then the request would be accepted.Besides, the system will also try to find out if the wasted food item matches with the requested food item. However, if multiple NGOs requests match with the restaurant’s leftover food, then the admin panel will look up the distance. If all of them are situated within the ten kilometer radius, then the one who requested first will be accepted.
The admin panel will tell the delivery person about locations. Once the food arrives, NGO representatives would send a confirmation notification to the system.
